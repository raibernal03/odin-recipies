        <p>Hot Dogs a la Mexicana (also known as salchichas) is a delicious and colorful dish that marries the flavors of Mexican cuisine with the satisfying taste of sausages.</p>
        <div class="ingredients">
            <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable or olive oil</li>
                <li>¼ cup white chopped onion</li>
                <li>1 small garlic, finely chopped</li>
                <li>4 Hot dog sausage regular size, cut into</li>
                <li>1-¼ cup chopped tomato (About 2 plum tomatoes or 6 oz)</li>
                <li>Salt to season</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="instructions">
            <h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat the oil at medium heat using a medium frying pan. </li>
                <li>Once the oil is hot, add the chopped onion and cook for about 1 to 2 minutes until it looks transparent.</li>
                <li>Stir in the serrano pepper and garlic, and cook for about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add the hotdogs slices and stir. Cook for 4 minutes; they will start to get a light golden color on the edges.</li>
                <li>Now, add the chopped tomato, cook and wait until it starts to simmer. About 5 minutes. Season with salt, cover the frying pan and lower the heat to medium heat.</li>
                <li>Allow to gentle cook for another 5 – 7 minutes until the tomatoes are cooked and had released their juices.  Serve with a side of refried beans and warm corn tortillas or bolillo.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>NOTES</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If you do not like spicy food, only add ½ of the serrano pepper</li>
                <li>You can also use ½ of Jalapeño pepper instead of Serrano. </li>
                <li>Some people like to add cilantro almost at the end of the cooking time. I like them without them. However, if you love cilantro, you can add 2 Tbsp. of chopped cilantro almost at the end of the cooking time. </li>
                <li>I used Oscar Mayer Classic Wieners Hot Dogs; you can use your favorite brand. This is only for comparison on the size of the wieners I used. </li>
                <li>This dish can be served with a side of refried beans and a side of warm crusty Mexican bolillo or make some tacos with corn tortillas.</li>
